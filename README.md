# Face Recognition

### A openCV face recongintion project

## Tools & Practices
| Version Control System| git & github |
| Language | [Python](https://www.python.org/) |
| Open Source | [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) |

In this project, image recognition is implemented by deep learning.
deep learning is Implemented in two steps:
1. face detection, which detects the presence and location of a face in an image, but does not identify it.
2. extract the 128-d feature vectors (called “embeddings”) that quantify each face in an image.

With this model we will be able to identify a specific person, and if a person is not in our repository we will be able to classify him as unknown.
